 
1. How can you make a copy of an object?
- By referencing to the same value that the object is referencing. For example :
let obj1=car={year: 2019} and if we want to copy obj1 , we can do:
let obj2=obj1; which means obj2 is referencing the same value that obj1 is referencing. To check whether obj1 and obj2 so that we correctly copied the obj1 object, we can check as:
console.log(obj1===obj2)  which is true shows the object is copied.

value?
- we can use trim() method which can remove the the spaces at the beginning and ending of a string.
