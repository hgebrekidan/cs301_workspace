3. Do functions need to be always commented? Write your understanding based on the reading.
 - No, if we are using arrow function we can use with out comment

4. When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?
 - When a function is one line statement its better to use function declaration
5. Function are values in JavaScript. They can be assigned, copied, or declared in any place of the
code. Is this a true or a false statement? Support your answer with examples.
 - It is true statement because since function always return values we can assign, copy or declare that
   value (function). For example if we are trying to make a program which checks the odd or even type of
   a number first and last digits of that number. In this case we can use two functions for reversing the 
   the number and checking the odd or even type. Therefore we can call reverseDigit function in to odd or
   even function. The called function return number so that we can do our calculation to know whether the
   number is even or odd.
