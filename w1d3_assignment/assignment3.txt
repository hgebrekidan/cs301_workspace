w1d3 Assignment 
1.  What happens when you forget a break while using switch statement?
if we forget putting break while we are using break the next case after 
the current case will be executed and if it satisfies the case the output 
will be over written and we will get the out put of the the current and next case which means
 the wrong solution. However this condition works if we are not forgetting to 
 put break on purpose otherwise we will get the intended result.
2. What will be the output of running following code?
var foo = 0;
switch (foo) {
 case -1:
 console.log('negative 1');   //  nothing will be printed
 break;
 case 0:
 console.log(0);   // output will be: 0
 case 1:
 console.log(1);   // output will be: 1
 break;
 case 2:
 console.log(2);    // nothing will be printed.
 break;
 default:
 console.log('default');   // nothing will be printed.
}
3. Will output change if value of foo is a �0� (0 in quotes) instead?
still nothing will be printed out.
